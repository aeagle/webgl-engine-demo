# WebGL engine demo

Playing around with WebGL to render some spinning dragons in the browser.

- Based on tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&t=5s but transposed from Java/OpenGL to TS/WebGL
- Dragon .obj file from blender in /demo/src/game/graphics/Dragon.obj
- Could form a very simple game engine

# To run

```
cd demo
npm install
npm start
```
